# Ninja should strike for conciseness; these three speakers beat me in terms of
# the length of the presentation title:
#   - Katrin Grimm:    Scagnostics
#   - Romain Francois: Rcpp11
#   - Hilary Parker:   Testdat

# evaluate the promises
slide_1  # knitter
slide_2  # ninja

# R is promising? sure, it has a lot of promises :-)

# Pakcage vignettes (http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/vignette/)
#   - before R 3.0, Sweave/PDF can be bad because you may have to download it
#     from CRAN page, and Jonathan Godfrey told me PDF is way less convenient
#     than HTML for the blind (Ninja should also have a tender part in their
#     heart to care others)
#   - now VignetteBuilder: knitr
#   - \VignetteEngine{knitr::docco_classic}
#   - press T on this vignette page:

# LyX + knitr
#   - https://github.com/yihui/knitr-book
#   - Ninja use whatever is convenient to themselves instead of blindly
#     believing the power of a single tool (I don't want to suffer from \\\\)

# R Markdown -> Word

sword(2)  # you feel the sound effect should be this now

# Fortran (yesterday with John Nash)
#   - Ninja don't know everything, so collaboration

# Julia (experimental)
#   - https://github.com/yihui/runr
#   - Ninja pay attention to new tools

# WordPress
#   - use XML-RPC, e.g. http://yihui.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php
#   - https://github.com/yihui/shinyWP (Weicheng Zhu's work, far from mature for now)
#   - the fastest way to become a Ninja is probably making use of one of
#     Duncan Temple Lang's packages, which are often undervalued (well,
#     sometimes never finished...)
