```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(width = 50, reindent.spaces = 2)
```

# Motivation (as a student and TA)

I do homework, I grade homework, and I saw this:

# Principle 1: Beautiful output by default

- code highlighting (package **highlight**)
    - hundreds of themes
- reformat code for lazy users (package **formatR**)

# Code highlighting

# Code reformatting

```{r reformat-no, tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## option tidy=FALSE
for(k in 1:10){j=cos(sin(k)*k^2)+3;print(j-5)}
```

Same code, reformatted:

```{r reformat-yes, tidy=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
## option tidy=TRUE
for(k in 1:10){j=cos(sin(k)*k^2)+3;print(j-5)}
```

# Principle 2: What you imagined is what you get

- running **knitr** gives you whatever you see in a normal R session
- `qplot(carat, price, data = diamonds)` just works; no need `print()`
- if your code produces two plots, you get two in the output
    - Sweave gives you one unless you use dark voodoo
- what if you have 50 plots? (demo)

# Principle 3: Focus on R programming

- you `plot()` only; `cat('\\includegraphics{}')` or `dev.off()` is not your job
    - **knitr** has all common graphical devices to save your plots into many formats; you should not manipulate a device in R code
- LaTeX tricks should be avoided unless they are really smart
    - `\setkeys{Gin}` is a terrible trick; you have `out.width` in **knitr** (e.g. `out.width = '.8\\textwidth'`)

# Principle 4: Be sustainable

Compare

```{r prompt-yes, prompt=TRUE, comment=NA}
(x = 0)
x = x + 1
```

to (default):

```{r prompt-no, prompt=FALSE, comment='##'}
(x = 0)
x = x + 1
```

You do not appreciate this unless you have been a homework grader.

# Principle 5: I write the core, you can define the decoration

- I parse/evaluate the code and give you the raw results, then you have control of everything
- for example
    - source code `1 + 1`
    - output `[1] 2`
    - _`\begin{verbatim}`_ `[1] 2` _`\end{verbatim}`_
    - or _`<div class="output">`_ `[1] 2` _`</div>`_
    - or ```` ```[1] 2``` ````

# Output hooks

You can control how the source code, normal output, warnings, messages, errors and plots are written in the output document.

```{r output-hook, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) {
    paste("\\begin{DearSource}", x, 
          "\\end{DearSource}", sep = "")
})
```

LaTeX, HTML, Markdown and reStructuredText have been supported, and it is straightforward to support other formats.

# Principle 6: All your base are belong to us

- the `tikz()` device supported by **pgfSweave**
- cache in **cacheSweave**
- automatic detection of chunk dependencies in **weaver**
- animations in my **animation** package
- **knitr** &asymp; Sweave + cacheSweave + pgfSweave + weaver + `animation::saveLatex` + `R2HTML::RweaveHTML` + `highlight::HighlightWeaveLatex` + 0.2 \* brew + 0.1 \* SweaveListingUtils + more
- without copying 700 lines of code

# Principle 7: Do not scare beginners

- you get reasonable output even if you do not set any options; just `knit()` it (convention over configuration)
- if you only have an R script, you can still do a report: `stitch()`
- if clicking a button works, click it
    - RStudio
    - LyX (demo)

# Principle 8: Open source is open

In theory you can use any language with **knitr**, e.g.

    <<test-python, engine='python'>>=
    x = 'hello, python world!'
    print x
    print x.split(' ')
    @

# Principle 9: Literate programming is programming

- we can go beyond the model of `Code + Documentation`
- a LP document can be programmable

# Programmable reports: Example 1

    <<setup>>=
    library(gridExtra)
    g = tableGrob(head(iris, 4))
    @
    
    <<draw-table, dev='png', dpi=150, fig.width=convertWidth(grobWidth(g), "in", value=TRUE), fig.height=convertHeight(grobHeight(g), "in", value=TRUE)>>=
    grid.draw(g)
    @

# Programmable reports: Example 2

Chunk hooks are functions associated with code chunks.

```{r tweet-hook, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
knit_hooks$set(tweet = function(before, options, envir) {
  library(twitteR)
  # Authentication with OAuth here, then
  if (!before) {
    msg = paste('I have finished the chunk',
                options$label, ', my Lord!')
    tweet(msg)
  }
})
# enable the chunk hook
opts_chunk$set(tweet = TRUE)
```

# Conclusions

- make reproducible research enjoyable first (new tools to hide gory details)
- all people do homework assignments before they do research, so make your homework reproducible first
- build extensible tools to satisfy both beginners and advanced users
- **knitr** allows any input languages and any output formats; attention to details
- reproducible blogging, exams/solutions, books, web tutorials, ...
